* ### Transformers-app
  *  Filter by faction functionality won't work with the default db.json because transformers don't have a faction property
  *  Added the faction property to all existing transformers and supplied the updated db.json file
  *  Replace the original db.json file with the new one locally before running the app, although it should still run even if the old db.json file is used
  *  Node_modules folder not included since it's a bit too 'heavy'
